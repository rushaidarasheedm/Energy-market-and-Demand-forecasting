# Energy-market-and-Demand-forecasting


Objective: Predict global oil consumption and production trends using real KAPSARC datasets to support demand–supply planning in the oil & gas sector.

Key Features:

Cleaned and reshaped raw KAPSARC energy data into quarterly time-series format

Built forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet) to project demand for 2025–2026

Conducted scenario analysis (e.g., +10% demand growth in Asia) to assess business impact

Visualized results with Python (Matplotlib) 

Tech Stack:
Python (Pandas, Statsmodels, Prophet, Matplotlib)
